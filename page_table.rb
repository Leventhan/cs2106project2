# Each entry of a PT can have three types of entry:

# â€’1 means the page is currently not resident in PM. Similar to a missing PT, a message is generated.

# 0 means the corresponding page does not exist. A read access results in an error. A write access causes the allocation of a new blank page.

# a positive integer, f, means that the page starts at physical address f .
